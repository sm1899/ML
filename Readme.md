# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, K-Means, and PCA using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These implementations were created as part of my machine learning course.

## Linear Regression

The linear regression implementation is in the `Liner Regression/Linear_Regression.ipynb` file. It includes a simple linear regression model along with functions for training and making predictions.

## K-Means

The K-Means implementation is in the `K-Means/K_means.ipynb` file. The code provides a basic K-Means clustering algorithm that can be used for unsupervised learning tasks.

## PCA using SVD

The PCA implementation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is in the `PCA/PCA_using_SVD.ipynb` file. This script demonstrates how to perform principal component analysis using SVD.
